# Onboarding engineers

This project is intended to kickstart the onboarding of new engineers and setup their working station fast so they can start coding straight away.

## Getting Started
The following instructions will help you prepare your local development environment and install prerequsites for your local data-stack. While most of the setup is automated, some steps may require manual installations. This environment is intended as a baseline, so personalization and recommendations are welcome.

### Setting up your Terminal
It is advised to install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). This is for convenience, extra commands, and customization of your terminal. For an introduction to customizing your terminal, see [this link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38/).

### Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager that mimics the Linux ```apt-get``` command, enabling you to install packages from the Terminal rather than manual install.

### XCode Command Line Tools
Ensure that you have XCode Command Line tools installed. You can find the source installation [here](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.14_for_Xcode_10.2/Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.14_for_Xcode_10.2.dmg).

## Guided Setup

   Run the installer scripts individually:
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

âœ¨ And thats it! No need to do anything further.

### Theme

My favourite theme is **[Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext)**! It's simple, it's
dark - it's fantastic!

### Font

A custom font? Yes, please! I'm currently a huge fan of Microsoft's **[Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)**.
Download the latest font zip file from the GitHub release page, unzip it and install every font within the "ttf" folder. Don't forget to
restart Visual Studio Code so that it knows about the font.
